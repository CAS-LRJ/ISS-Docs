# ISS

Intelligent Self-driving System (ISS) is a modular framework written in Python and C++. The aim for this framework is to build a extensible framework for research propose. This framework will contain both classic and deep learning algorithms for self-driving tasks such as perception, localization, mapping, prediction, planning and control. The modular design with minimal external library can provide a transparent and clean workspace for researchers to evaluate ADS alogirhtms.
